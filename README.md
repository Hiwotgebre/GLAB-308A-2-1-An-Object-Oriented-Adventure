# GLAB-308A-2-1-An-Object-Oriented-Adventure
# Object-Oriented Adventure Game

This project is a simple text-based adventure game developed using JavaScript. It demonstrates the application of object-oriented programming (OOP) principles such as classes, inheritance, and encapsulation.

## Project Overview

The game models an adventure scenario where the player, "Robin," along with companions, explores a fantasy world. The game supports basic interactions like rolling dice and scouting ahead, integral to navigating and surviving the adventure.

### Features

- **Character Creation**: Define characters using classes, setting properties like name, health, and inventory.
- **Companions**: Extend the basic character class to include companions for the main characters.
- **Interactive Methods**: Implement methods like `roll()` for dice rolls and `scout()` for exploring the environment.
